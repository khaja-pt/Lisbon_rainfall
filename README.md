The water cycle illustrates how rainfall transpires. Water on the earth’s surface evaporates and ascends until it reaches a height where the temperature is extremely low. Due to these cold conditions, the water vapor condenses to form water droplets on minuscule dust particles. These particles accumulate to form clouds. When the amount of water droplets starts to increase, the cloud gets heavier, making it difficult for the water to stay suspended in the air. At one point, the clouds become too heavy, and the droplets fall down as rain.

A crucial aspect of forming clouds is the amount of water that evaporates off the earth’s surface. A more rapid rate of evaporation takes place at higher temperatures because water is provided with more heat energy to transition from a liquid to a gas.

When directly comparing temperature and rainfall, the relation is not exactly directly proportional. When inspecting weather patterns, the trend that is visible is that after a period of high temperatures, where water evaporation occurs, rainfall follows. However, on the days when rainfall happens, the temperatures are usually lower than before the rain fell.

Besides temperature, wind also plays a role when considering the amount of rainfall. The wind sweeps over bodies of water and gathers moisture, which in turn helps form rain in the form of clouds. The stronger the winds, the more rainfall a place will likely experience.

Lisbon is a city located on the western edge of Portugal, along the Atlantic Ocean, and its climate is characterized by warm to hot, dry summers and mild to cool, wet winters. During the summer months (June through September), temperatures in Lisbon can rise significantly, contributing to the evaporation of water. However, these are also the months when rainfall is relatively low because the high pressure systems that tend to sit over the region block the entry of moist air masses and hence the formation of rain-bearing clouds.

Conversely, during the late autumn, winter, and early spring months (October through May), while temperatures are lower, rainfall tends to be more substantial. This is due to the lower pressure systems that prevail over the region during these months, allowing the entry of moist air masses from the Atlantic, which then condense and fall as rain.

The proximity of Lisbon to the Atlantic Ocean does affect its rainfall patterns. The ocean, being a large body of water, has a high evaporation rate, leading to a greater amount of moisture being available in the atmosphere. This moisture, when blown over land by prevailing winds, contributes to the formation of clouds and rainfall. So, while Lisbon does not receive as much rainfall as some coastal cities due to its Mediterranean climate, the influence of the ocean is still significant.
